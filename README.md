## About 
I've created a fork from voxmatt so I can implement another function to control the bell separate from the push button on the door. I will create a new accessory for the bell so I can schedule it using the home app.
Also I will make a simple install manual using homebridge UI. For the original project visit Voxmatt.

A Homebridge plugin for a Raspberry Pi with an Automation Hat that is controlling an old, buzzer-activated door gate. Directly inspired by [this article](https://medium.com/dirigible/siri-controlled-1970s-intercom-door-ecd7a6b0df31) Please note that this plugin represents only the software component. The hardware is a different manner entirely, but is explained in the above mentioned article. Maybe I'll get around to detailing it someday...

## Administration on the Raspberry Pi

**To SSH:**

1. Make sure the Raspberry Pi is running
2. Run `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` in a terminal window
3. Enter the password for the Raspberry Pi

Homebridge config on the Raspberry Pi is configured here
```
~/.homebridge/config.json
```

To shutdown run: `sudo shutdown -h now`

To run the plugin locally on the raspberry pi (instead of from npm):
`DEBUG=* /usr/bin/homebridge -D -P doorbell/`

**To enable the reboot daemon**

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable homebridge
systemctl start homebridge
```

**To check the status**

```
systemctl status homebridge
```
